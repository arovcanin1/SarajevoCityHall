## POI 
### Marble slab
Given that there is a marble slab with an inscription located at the City Hall, clicking on this POI displays the mentioned inscription.

### Book
Since the reconstruction of the City Hall lasted for a long time, and considering its architectural style, clicking on the book displays a gallery of pictures showing the interior of the City Hall.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina flag 
As one of the POIs, I have placed the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina since it is located at the City Hall. Clicking on the flag starts a video that contains all the photos of the City Hall when it was illuminated with the colors of flags of other countries as a sign of solidarity.
